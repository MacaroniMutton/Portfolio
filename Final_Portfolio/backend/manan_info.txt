Summary
I am a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student with a CGPA of 9.99, passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning,
and backend development. I have hands-on experience with EDA, supervised and unsupervised learning, and advanced
deep learning techniques such as ANN, CNN, and LSTM. I’ve worked on real-world tasks in computer vision, NLP, and
transformer models. Notable projects include a deepfake detector using TensorFlow and a fashion recommender system
built with Django. I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a Data Science or Machine Learning internship.

Projects
Conversational RAG Bot | Langchain, HuggingFace, Groq API, Ollama, FAISS 2024
• Built a conversational RAG bot with message history using Langchain, Hugging Face embeddings, and LLMs from
Groq API and Ollama.
• Utilized FAISS vector store to store embeddings of document chunks, enabling efficient similarity search to retrieve
relevant context.
• Passed retrieved context as a prompt to the LLM model along with user input, enhancing the bot’s conversational
relevance and accuracy.
OCR for Product Dimension Extraction (Amazon ML Hackathon) | IDEFICS, EasyOCR 2024
• Used IDEFICS multimodal model along with OCR to perform Visual Question Answering (VQA) for extracting
product dimensions such as weight, height, and width from images of Amazon products.
• Implemented and fine-tuned OCR models (Pytesseract, EasyOCR, KerasOCR) to enhance accuracy in reading and
processing product dimensions.
• Developed an efficient solution to extract precise dimensional data from product images for e-commerce
applications.
Deepfake Detector | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Random Forest 2023
• Developed a deepfake detection model using TensorFlow’s MoveNet, PyTorch’s DenseNet16, and Random Forest
for audio detection.
• Achieved 85-90% accuracy in detecting deepfake videos by integrating video and audio components.
Fashion Recommender System (SE Hackathon Top 12) | ResNet, Collaborative Filtering, Django 2023
• Developed a fashion recommender system using ResNet and collaborative filtering.
• Integrated Gemini API for real-time image comparison.
Plane Crash Search using Bayesian Search Theory | Django, LeafletJS, Bayesian Theory 2024
• Built a plane crash search simulation using Bayesian Search Theory, A* Search Algorithm, and Kernel Density
Estimation. The optimal search path can be exported in CSV format for use by rescue teams.
• Integrated Django backend, LeafletJS for geospatial visualization, Selenium for automated data retrieval, and
Meteomatics API to access wind and ocean wave velocities for algorithmically backtracking recovered debris.
• Converted gathered geographic and flight data into meaningful probability distributions, and performed
visualisation with Seaborn and Matplotlib to provide insights to the Search and Rescue Team.
Chat Application | React, Flask, Socket.io
A real-time chat application that enables seamless communication between users. It leverages WebSockets to provide instant message delivery and updates, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. The app includes features like private chats, typing indicators, and message history.
Flappy Bird with Face Controls | Pygame, OpenCV
An innovative take on the classic Flappy Bird game, where the bird's movements are controlled using face tracking. By integrating OpenCV's face detection technology with Pygame, the game offers a hands-free, interactive gaming experience. Users can control the bird by tilting their heads or using facial gestures, making it both fun and challenging.
Plant Species Classification App | Pytorch, Flask, React
A machine learning-powered application designed to classify plant species with high precision. Using an ensemble of advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGGNet, InceptionNet, and ResNet, the app achieves a remarkable accuracy of 91% across 47 plant species. The frontend allows users to upload images, and the backend processes them to return classification results quickly.
Calorie Tracker | Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Nutrition API
A fitness-oriented web application for tracking calories and nutritional intake. It helps users maintain a healthy lifestyle by providing detailed insights into their daily food consumption. Integrated with a Nutrition API, the app allows users to search for food items, view nutritional details, and track their calorie goals. Its user-friendly interface makes it a go-to tool for fitness enthusiasts.
